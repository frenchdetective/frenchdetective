# Cybersecurity Analyst
I have been passionate about computing since childhood and have recently transitioned into cybersecurity with a focus on Blue Team operations. 
Every day, I deepen my expertise in defensive strategies and the role of a SOC analyst through targeted training and hands-on practice.
As a versatile professional, I enjoy exploring new domains and continually expanding my skill set.
